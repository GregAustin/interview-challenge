Notes:

I split the app into individual components in a way that I thought made sense, and implemented the required functionality.
I have done this in a fairly basic way, by keeping all app state in the App class and passing functionality down to the components as props.
I have not implemented any testing. I tried to use Jest for this but I am not very familiar with it.
